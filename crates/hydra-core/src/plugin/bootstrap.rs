//! First-startup install + post-upgrade refresh hooks for the plugin
//! marketplace layer.
//!
//! Two distinct user journeys land here:
//!
//! 1. **Fresh install** — hydra runs for the first time on a host
//!    that has never run it. The marker file
//!    `$HYDRA_HOME/.plugin_bootstrap_v1` does not exist. We `git clone`
//!    the default `hydra-skills` marketplace and touch the marker.
//!    Failure (no network, no git on PATH, upstream down) is logged
//!    and swallowed — startup proceeds without skills.
//!
//! 2. **Existing user, just upgraded** — `apply_pending_upgrade`
//!    re-exec'd into the new binary and set `HYDRA_UPGRADED_FROM`.
//!    We `git pull --ff-only` every installed marketplace so the
//!    skills track the new binary. Same swallowed-failure semantics.
//!
//! The marker file makes (1) a one-time event. If the user later runs
//! `/plugin uninstall hydra-skills`, the marker stays and we
//! respect their intent — no re-install on subsequent startups. To
//! force a re-bootstrap, the user can `rm $HYDRA_HOME/.plugin_bootstrap_v1`.
//!
//! Both functions are best-effort and never propagate errors —
//! hydra must remain usable on offline machines, in air-gapped
//! corporate environments, on systems without git, etc.
