//! In-place binary upgrade for hydra.
//!
//! Flow:
//! 1. Fetch `latest.json` manifest (version + per-target sha256/size).
//! 2. Detect current platform and pick the matching binary entry.
//! 3. Verify we can write to `current_exe()`'s directory — if not, fail
//!    with a precise message telling the user to re-run with `sudo`.
//! 4. Download the binary to a sibling temp file, streaming progress.
//! 5. Verify SHA256 against the manifest. Bail (and delete temp) on
//!    mismatch — we never touch the live binary until verification
//!    passes.
//! 6. Three-way swap to replace the live binary:
//!    a. `hydra` → `.hydra.rolling`  (Windows allows renaming a running exe)
//!    b. new binary → `hydra`            (install the upgrade)
//!    c. best-effort: remove old `.bak`, then `.hydra.rolling` → `.bak`
//!
//!    Steps a–b are the critical path; step c is best-effort. If the old
//!    `.bak` is locked (AV scanner, still-running process, read-only
//!    attribute), the upgrade still succeeds — the `.rolling` file lingers
//!    and is cleaned up on the next upgrade attempt.
//!
//! Rollback swaps the live binary with `.bak` in place, so one backup
//! always points to "the other version" — the user can toggle by
//! alternating `/upgrade` and `/upgrade rollback`.
