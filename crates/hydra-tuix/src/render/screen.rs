// crates/hydra-tuix/src/render/screen.rs
//
// Retained-mode screen buffer — the backbone of the Ink-style
// renderer. Owns two parallel `W × H` cell grids:
//
//   * `cells`      — the frame we are *currently building*. Widget
//                    draws (footer / body / menu) mutate this before
//                    `render_diff` is called.
//   * `prev_cells` — the frame we *last emitted to the terminal*.
//                    Diff basis for the next paint.
//
// `render_diff` computes the patch stream from (prev → current),
// serialises it to ANSI bytes, swaps the frames (current becomes
// prev, prev becomes the fresh scratch we'll next rebuild into) and
// blanks the new scratch so partial draws don't leave stale cells.
//
// Design notes vs. the previous immediate-mode path:
//
//   * **No DECSTBM scroll region**: footer and body share one grid.
//     Scrolling the body is `scroll_up(bottom, n)` — an O(bottom)
//     memcpy inside the grid; terminal-side scrolling happens only
//     via the diff (blank cells appear at the bottom, content that
//     was there now lives higher).
//
//   * **No separate cache invalidation path**: `invalidate()` fills
//     `prev_cells` with blanks so the next `render_diff` emits
//     everything currently in `cells` as if cold-starting. Covers
//     resume-from-external, resize, and any "terminal state is
//     unknown" situation uniformly.
//
//   * **Cursor and visibility** are frame-level state. Visibility is
//     hidden at the head of the diff and restored at the tail; cursor
//     position parks at the tail. Never interleaved with cell writes,
//     so the caret can't be seen jumping across the screen between
//     patches. Frames that emit no work skip the wrap entirely.
