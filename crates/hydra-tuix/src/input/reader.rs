/// Burst-aggregation poll timeout — how long the burst detector waits
/// for the next event before deciding the burst is over. Picked per-OS
/// because terminal stdin delivery cadence differs:
///
/// - **Windows** (PowerShell / Windows Terminal / conhost): bracketed
///   paste payloads and char-by-char fallback delivery arrive in
///   chunked stdin batches with 5-12 ms gaps between chunks; the old
///   2 ms window split one logical Ctrl+V into 5-10 `[Pasted #N]`
///   placeholders. 15 ms swallows those gaps without meaningfully
///   extending per-keystroke typing latency — still well below the
///   ~20 ms human perception floor.
/// - **macOS / Linux**: bracketed paste arrives as one event in
///   practice; the timeout only matters for the rare no-bracketed-paste
///   fallback. 4 ms covers occasional 2-3 ms gaps seen on slow SSH
///   sessions without adding perceptible typing lag.
///
/// Prior art: DeepSeek-TUI's `paste_burst.rs` ships Windows 60 ms /
/// Unix 8 ms, but those depend on a two-stage state machine
/// (short pending window → long active window) that gates the long
/// timeout behind "burst confirmed". hydra currently runs the
/// timeout on *every* keystroke, so we keep both values comfortably
/// below human perception. A follow-up will add the state machine,
/// after which 60 ms can be safely adopted on Windows.
